### Foreign Policy
- Question: Who should Israel align with?
	1. Western
	2. Sovient Union
	3. Independent foreign policy
- Why did it matter?
	- Agriculture belonged to kibbutzim
	- Urban belonged to Union
	- Strong left-wing social democratic ethos
- Fears of WW2
	- Fear: Germany would invade Middle East --> Almost did
	- Sovient Union played huge force in defeating Germany, pushed back German forces did so more than US
	- Jews became grateful to Sovient Union

- SU did not support Jewish nationalism beyond Birobidzhan
	- Not sympathetic to Zionism
	- Ironic: SU supported idea of partition, twice --> Surprised EVERYONE
		- Wanted to create trouble for British and America
		- Wanted to ally with Israel
- Issues for Israel and Palestine to look to SU
	1. Socialist factor of Yishuv, Israelis were mostly socialist
	2. Experience of WW2
	3. Supported the idea of a Jewish State
	4. Number of Jews that remained behind in Sovient Union countries --> Jews in Israel afraid to lose connections with other Jews
- Identifying with SU: Communist vs. Socialist
	- Communists no to Socialists: Disrupted the working class
	- Israelis: Social-Democrats, not sympathetic to suppression of civil rights within SU
		- Discussions with Mapai

- Identifying with US
	- Pros:
		- Weapons
		- Large Jewish communities in America
		- Values US represented
		- Alliance with West-European countries (GB, FR, GER)
- Back in the day: Non-Alignment was difficult position to hold unless you were a big country
	- NAC not an option for Israel
	- Required identification with a bigger country for support
	- NAC were new countries as a result to decolonization
	- NAC block were in Asia, many opposed to Israel because many Asian countries were muslim
- Decision: Left with Mapai, divided
	- Mapai: Wanted non-alignments
	- Mapam: Left-wing, supported SU identification
- Israel aligned with West
	- SU turns on its on Jewish communities in SU provinces --> Purging Jews from SU
		- Jewish leaders were executed in SU --> Orders under Moscow
		- Trend appeared in Communist countries
		- Communist world moving away from allying self with Israel
		- Stalin arrests Jewish doctors who were charged with attempting to murder Stalin
	- Ben-Gurion sides with US during Korean war --> Turning point for Israel
	- Support of SU was not smart for a Jewish country
- SU breaks alliance with Israel
- Arab countries wanted to start another war with Israel
	- Israel looked for sources of weapons
		- US did not support them and did not sell them arms until Kennedy administration 
		- Had no sources for arms
