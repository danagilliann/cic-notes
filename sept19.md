## Post-1948 Immigration
- 1948 - Declaration of State of Israel, mass immigration
	- Open to Jewish Immigration --> Demand of Zionist movement
		- If British declared Jewish Immigration, declaration would not have happened earlier
		- Palestine became controversial
		- Importance to Zionist: Jews in diaspora faced historical crisis --> Holocaust, difficult living conditions in Europe
			- Asylum necessary
			- Jews looked for alternative
		- Free entry of Jews from anywhere
		- Non-selective policy --> Old and sick welcome
	- 3 year period, Jewish population doubled
		- Economy not capable of accepting immigrants
	- Opened doors to Jews in need --> Israel: Only state to accept holocaust survivors
		- Survivors of Holocaust
		- Jews in countries which allied itself with Germany and Axis powers
		- Jews in Iraq --> Iraq defended Palestinian Arabs but angry at Jews, awks
			- Integrated with Iraqi life, spoke Arabic, Zionism did not infiltrate Iraqi Jews, some Iraqi-Jews were affluent 
			- Jews leave Iraq illegally
			- Iraq government: Population exchange 
				- Iraq: Palestinian Refugees, Israel: Jews in Israel, Iraq takes Jewish property
				- Result: Kicked Jews out, got property, never took Palestinian refugees
		- Vichy-France hurt relations with Jews and French, Nazi presence hurt it further, Decolonization
		- Decolonization
			- Local nationalism thrived
			- Local minorities thrived
		- Decolonization, WW2, Arab-Israeli Conflict --> Affected the Jews
			- Some willing to move, others only option
			- Posed problems within the economy
- Economy collapsing 1951
	- Restricted immigration and selective immigration --> Idealogical debates
	- Selective: Young and healthy, older and sick must wait
- 1955, better economy --> More generous immigration policy
- New Jews were different from Jews pre-1948 
	- Jewish struggle --> Biblical sense
	- Less secular
	- Mass-immigration changed the ethos of country, radically changing nature of state
	- Restrictive immigration laws were though to be a racist policy
	- Too many Jews in urban areas --> Resulted in developing towns (really shitty towns)
		- Arab housing had to be recycled --> Taken by Jewish-Europeans
		- Ma'abarot --> Symbol of disadvantaged and slums of Israel
			- Last Jews lived in refugee camps 
			- 17% of the population 
			- Basis of development towns
	- Idealogy of Immigration: Not sustainable
	- Economy did not totally collapse thanks to money from British --> No foreign currency
	- Most Jews considered it a step-up except German-Jews and Iraqi-Jews
- Melting pot policy
	- All immigrants had to agree with the Israeli-Jewish culture
	- Foreigners had to hide their foreigness and previous cultural identity
	- Jewish government wanted to create an Israeli identity
